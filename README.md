This program simulates a cash register. The user can calculate the appropriate change due to a customer based off of a sale amount, the amount of cash given by the customer, and the current state of the cash drawer. The sale amount and cash-given amount are editable by the user, and the cash drawer can by randomized, emptied, or each slot can be configured to the user's desired dollar amount.

The main program is the "make-change.ts" file.
